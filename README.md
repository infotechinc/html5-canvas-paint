Info Tech, Inc. sponsors a mentoring program with University of Florida's **Women In Computer Science and Engineering (WICSE)** club. The program gives students the opportunity to create their own software project while utilizing feedback and assistance from Info Tech developers. This repository contains the results of Sydney Achinger's project from the Fall 2018 program. 

Sydney was mentored by Joshua Brown. TDD and other best practices were emphasized and followed as time permitted.


# Paint Project

The "Paint Project" allows users to create resizable shapes by clicking and dragging on an HTML5 canvas. In addition to providing a learning opportunity for Sydney, the project sought to deliver features such as a draggable arrow tool and togglable "annotations" to show which user created a shape.

# Dependencies

"Paint Project" depends on Fabric.js and Iron-Icons. For development, the project depends on Iron-Test-Helpers.
